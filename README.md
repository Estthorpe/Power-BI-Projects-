**Inpatient / Outpatient Dashboard**
A repository of Power BI Projects/Dashboards 


**Project Overview**
This project is a Power BI dashboard designed to analyze inpatient and outpatient waiting lists. The goal is to provide insights into patient wait times, track historical trends, and analyze detailed demographic information such as speciality level and age profiles.

**Project Goals**
Track the current status of the patient waiting list.
Analyze historical monthly trends (2018-2021) in the inpatient and outpatient categories.
Perform detailed analysis at the specialty level and age profile.

**Data Scope**
Time Period: 2018-2021
Metrics Included:
  Average & Median Waiting List
  Current Total Wait List

**Dashboard Views**
Summary Page – A high-level overview of key metrics.
Detailed Page – Granular analysis of patient categories.

**Tools Used**
Power BI – Data visualization and reporting.
Power Query – Data transformation and cleaning.

  **Insights & Findings**
Waiting List Trends: The inpatient and outpatient waiting lists have shown fluctuations over time, with peak waiting periods observed during certain months, particularly in winter.
Age Group Analysis: The majority of patients on the waiting list fall within the 45-65 age group, highlighting the need for targeted healthcare interventions.
Specialty-Level Analysis: Certain specialties, such as orthopaedic and cardiology, have significantly longer waiting times compared to general outpatient services.
Current Waiting List Status: The latest data indicates an increasing backlog in inpatient services, suggesting a need for optimized resource allocation.
Comparison of Median vs. Average Waiting Time: There is a noticeable gap between median and average waiting times, indicating some extreme cases of long waits affecting the overall mean.

**Future Enhancements**
Integration with real-time data sources.
Additional filters and drill-through capabilities for enhanced analysis.
